coll001,Open_heart.jpg,,,Heart and Vascular,"Rew, Branden",1794,"European colonists originally came into this land in terms of exploration, not even reaching their intended destination and beginning the stigma of Native Americans being called Indians until this day. That’s not the point, but it can serve as an accurate example of the disrespect and dehumanization that the natives were placed under. Columbus being the first known explorer of the “New World,” of course had to sail back to Spain and report to the Catholic monarchs he served under. It’s compelling how after one trip back to the rulers, things turn violent and less respective. The Catholic Church convinced the public that these were devil’s advocates and barbarians that should not have respect or simple rights. This country was taken over with ease, due to the power, population, and technology of the Europeans. Even when they lived in harmony, the Europeans would boot them and did whatever was best for them. Colonists, explorers, and pilgrims all came here as a means to an end or an escape from a harsh reality, but eventually they treated Native Americans the same way the British treated the new Americans. A thirst for power and prosperity led to so much discrimination and an overall terrible way to treat fellow humans. Since this dissociation of races and their culture embedded itself in European American culture for so long, the now unified American culture has leaked discriminative thoughts into people today. Generation after generation.

coll004,Manuscript1.jpg,,,Manuscript,"Lee, Nate",1426,"The title at the top of the page translates to “Cornelius Celsus: The Book of Medicine Begins”, which is curious because it's commonly expected that a “textbook” doesn’t shine off the page such as this one, yet this page draws readers in with its elegant and uniform decoration of flowers. These plants and flowers are arranged differently on each side of the page, but each side represents a uniform decoration of a colorful floral arrangement, and could quite possibly represent medicinal herbs and plants that were used when this book was published. The color and illustration surrounding the page is unique to the first page, when most of the book does not use this surrounding design. Giving that this is the origin of a book of herbs and medicine, it fits that a unique arrangement of plants surround the content, and the attention to detail and consistency is impressive and beautiful to say the least.",Medicine,Gallia Narbonensis,45.07816,8.83521,Library Catalog,,,,,,
